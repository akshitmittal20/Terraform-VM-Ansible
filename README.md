# Terraform-VM-Ansible
A Project to showcase how to :-
Provision a Virtual machine with the help of IaC in Terraform and how to build the playbooks to install various packages in the created VM.

- We wil use Terraform to build a virtual machine, Which is AWS EC2 instance in our case, and then use Ansible to install the necessary applications on that machine.
- Launch an EC2 instance using Terraform
- Connect to the instance
- Install Git, Ansible, Jenkins, Java and Python in the instance

# Pre-Requisites

# Motivation
Nowadays, infrastructure automation is critical. We tend to put the most emphasis on software
development processes, but infrastructure deployment strategy is just as important. Infrastructure
automation not only aids disaster recovery, but it also facilitates testing and development.
